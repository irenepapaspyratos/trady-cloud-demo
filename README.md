# Trady Cloud Demo

This project is the final project of the AWS Cloud Development Bootcamp I visited September-December 2022 at *Neue Fische*.

It contains a demo application, which serverless sends real time event-trading signals from the AWS Cloud to a trading bot. The infrastructure is being generated with Terraform while CI/CD principles are followed via Github Workflows.
