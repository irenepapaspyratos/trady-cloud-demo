# Trady Cloud Demo

This project is the final project of the AWS Cloud Development Bootcamp I visited September-December 2022 at *Neue Fische*.

It contains a demo application, which sends real time event-trading signals serverless from the AWS Cloud to a trading bot. The infrastructure is being generated with Terraform while CI/CD principles are followed via Github Workflows. As certain functions connot be used in the sandbox of AWS, this project was created bypassing those restrictions.
